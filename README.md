This is a repository for Hack on the Hill 2016. This project is a political web app / social experiment.

With this app, you can anonymously tweet @Hillary or @Trump, the two presidential candidates. Tweets are posted to an anonymous Twitter account @sproulhacks. 

You can either generate a random tweet or create a custom tweet. 

Below, you can also see the most recent tweets around the world that mention 'Clinton' or 'Trump' to see what the political mood is at the moment.

This is a platform for those interested in politics to participate in the election of 2016.
